Key Performance Indicators (KPI):
• Conversion rate: Percentage of visitors who make a purchase
• Traffic: Refers to the number of visitors or users who navigate to a website or web page.
• Bounce Rate: Measures the percentage of website visitors who navigate away from the site after viewing only one page, without interacting further.
• Cart Abandonment Rate: The percentage of online shoppers who add items to their shopping cart but leave the website without completing the purchase.
• Average Order Value: Average amount spent by a customer per transaction.

Findings:
• Desktop Dominance: Desktop users have a higher conversion rate across all channels compared to mobile users. This could be due to larger screen sizes and more controlled browsing environments.
• Mobile Conversion Challenges: Mobile devices have lower conversion rates, which might be due to smaller screen sizes, distractions, and a less optimal browsing experience.
• Paid search generated the highest revenue and profit compared to other channels.
• The Original Mr. Fuzzy generated the highest revenue compared to other products.
• The Original Mr. Fuzzy had a greater number of web sessions and page views, which might be one of the reasons for generating the highest revenue.
• The highest drop-off points are typically between “Home to Specific Product” and “Cart” and “Shipping.” This suggests users might be facing issues with product selection or the checkout process.

Recommendations:
• Mobile Optimization: Ensure mobile-friendliness with responsive design, optimized load times, and streamlined navigation.
• Implement push notifications for abandoned carts, new arrivals, and special offers.
